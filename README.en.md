----
Abyss Together is a card-based roguelike RPG game. The player takes on the role of the leader of a party of four heroes who have fallen into a vertical cave. The leader guides the party through battles against monsters blocking their path in order to return to the surface. Across 17 stages, players must collect items and potions to defeat increasingly powerful monsters.

The core of the game design is centered on not losing party members. This concept started by subverting typical deck-building roguelikes. If a party member dies, the cards that member would have provided are no longer available, and the deck can quickly become depleted as if falling off a cliff.

Developed using the Unity Engine and C#, generative AI was used to create some of the images. Coding focused mainly on implementing features, with a particular emphasis on producing animations using DOTween. This is a one-person development project where planning, design, and development were all carried out by a single individual, with a total development time of 2 weeks.
